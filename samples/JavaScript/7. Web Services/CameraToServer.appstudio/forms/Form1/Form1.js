 //This sample lets you get a picture from the camera or the Photo Library
 //and display it on your screen and:
 //    - Push it to a web server in base64 or PNG format using an AJAX POST
 //    - Receive a response from the server and do something with it.
 //This is a mod of the original Camera Sample file.
 //  You must have the supplied PHP files in the same location
 //  as the AppStudio production files.
 //
 //To control when a pic may be sent or that a pic is not sent
 //multiple times by click happy users, btnSubmitImages is placed
 //in different states of visiblility and/or usability by way of the 
 //SentFlag.

 //Note: PictureBox1 is in the negative left of the form.
 //      This is a trick that developers use to hide controls
 //      from the users but still have availability to them.
 //
 //      Image1 is used for preview ONLY because viewing PictureBox1
 //      isn't very realistic for viewing because it exceeds the 
 //      mobile screen size.  (You can size the PictureBox to any size
 //      a camera is capable of, but beware, size does matter!  The lag
 //      to insert an image into a db gets longer as the pics get larger.
 //      I also noticed phpmyadmin is not very responsive to large images AND
 //      I have had timeouts when loading pages with lots of images.  I suspect
 //      some sort of slide presentation tool that controls the load of
 //      the images will be in order to view large quantities of photos
 //      (lot's of opensource for slide views)
